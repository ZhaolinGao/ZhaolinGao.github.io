I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>. I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.engineering.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>. My research includes representation learning, collaborative filtering, natural language processing, and graph neural network. My work has been published at CVPR, WWW, SIGIR, RecSys, and INFOCOM.

I am also a part-time content creator with more than 50,000 followers and 10 million views on [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/537049440), [Douyin](https://www.douyin.com/user/MS4wLjABAAAAmk2iWqbZmPZZfGJBKYwdhxciN6D24MsoaagyrSWbK6eQxObsfmIFFINyM3RLqnOc), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/gitbag).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
