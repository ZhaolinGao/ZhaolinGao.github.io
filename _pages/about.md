I'm a third-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at <a  href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>, where I am advised by <a  href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/">Thorsten Joachims</a> and <a  href="https://wensun.github.io/">Wen Sun</a>, and a part-time Researcher at Meta Superintelligence. My research includes reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. My work has been published at NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, WWW, SIGIR, CIKM, RecSys, and INFOCOM.

I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at <a  href="https://www.engineering.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>, where I had the privilege of working with <a  href="https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/bli/">Baochun Li</a>, <a  href="https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/ssanner/">Scott Sanner</a>, and <a  href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mvolkovs/">Maksims Volkovs</a>.

I am also a part-time content creator with more than 50,000 followers and 10 million views on [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/537049440), [Douyin](https://www.douyin.com/user/MS4wLjABAAAAmk2iWqbZmPZZfGJBKYwdhxciN6D24MsoaagyrSWbK6eQxObsfmIFFINyM3RLqnOc), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/gitbag).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
